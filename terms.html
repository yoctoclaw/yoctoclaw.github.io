<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

<h2>The software</h2>
<p>KrillClaw™ is open-source software released under the MIT License. You are free to use, modify, and distribute it subject to the terms of that license.</p>

<h2>No warranty</h2>
<p>KrillClaw is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We are not responsible for what you build with it, what devices you install it on, or what actions the AI agent takes. You are responsible for reviewing and supervising agent behavior on your hardware.</p>

<h2>Hardware use</h2>
<p>KrillClaw is designed for microcontrollers and embedded devices. If you install it on safety-critical systems (medical devices, vehicles, industrial equipment), you do so at your own risk. Always implement appropriate safety interlocks independent of the AI agent.</p>

<h2>LLM providers</h2>
<p>KrillClaw connects to third-party LLM providers that you configure. Your use of those services is governed by their terms. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content or policies of any third-party provider.</p>

<h2>Pre-flashed devices</h2>
<p>If and when we offer pre-flashed hardware devices, those will be sold as development tools, not consumer products. They are intended for developers and makers who understand the capabilities and limitations of AI agent systems.</p>

<h2>Trademarks</h2>
<p>KrillClaw™ is a trademark of Accelerando AI. The KrillClaw name and shrimp logo may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not ours without prior written consent.</p>

<h2>Patent</h2>
<p>Patent pending. Certain aspects of KrillClaw's architecture and methods are the subject of pending patent applications.</p>
